"""Playwright CLI skill auto-injection extension.

Runs at slot _16_ (before _20_browser_plugin_config).
When browser_backend is set to 'playwright_cli' in plugin config, injects the
official playwright-cli SKILL.md content into the agent system prompt so the
agent automatically knows all playwright-cli commands without needing to manually
load the skill.
